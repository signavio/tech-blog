Junit5 is slated for a GA release in Q1 2017.
If you are like me then you love testing, and would be curious as to what Junit5 brings to the table, whether or not it would be worth starting to use it, and if you have tests already, migrating those to it.
 

Is Java8 required?
JUnit 5 requires Java 8 at runtime. However, you can still test code that has been compiled with previous versions of the JDK.
try out scenarios

How to choose runner?
coming from testng?
coming from junit4

try just changing the import

New features
description - meh
assertAll - kinda cool, similar to soft assertions in assertj
assertThrows - compare to assertj

Nested Tests - allows group of tests, eg stack example, could be useful, anything in testng/junit4?

parameteried tests are cool for injection dependencies into test methods
extendwith
two parameters of same type? ->  instantiates eg twice
2 resolvers clashing -> error at runtime

got up to section 3.10

Basic intro

Moving from junit4 to junit5
