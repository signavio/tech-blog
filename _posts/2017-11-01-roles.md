Like most tech companies, Signavio's engineering department can more-or-less roughly be divided into two parts--the front-end and the back-end. Our front-end folks include the front-end engineers (naturally) as well as our quality assurance engineers and tech writers. The back-end includes our back-end engineers, our project managers, and our Agile coaches. Here is more information about each.


##Back-End Engineers
Our back-end engineers focus on maintaining and continuously upgrading our servers.
They find and update or replace legacy code in our stack, and make sure that things run smoothly.
Their work is almost never noticed by users, but it is extremely important.


##Quality Assurance Engineers
Signavio's Quality Assurance team works to ensure our products are shipped free of bugs or other defects, and that our products don't break when our customers use them.
They focus on raising ownership of our products, which is very important in a company of our size.
We need to have pride in our products, otherwise what's the point in designing and maintaining them?


##Project Managers
Project Managers coordinate between their teams, the sales department, and our customers, all to better deliver our products.
Each project manager is an expert on their team's particular project, which makes it easier for our sales people to use them as a point person for any question potential clients might have.

##Agile Coaches
The goal of our Agile team is to continue to make Signavio a place where it's fun and rewarding to work, while continuing to improve our internal processes.
After all, we spend most of our lives at work--why not make it enjoyable?

They help our project managers with team management--helping them to develop ideas and encourage their members to come up with solutions on their own without extra coaching.
They want to courage teams to talk to each other, ask a lot of questions, challenge the status quo and feel safe to broach new ideas and ways of completing work without compromising quality for speed.
They focus on coming up with ways to change and improve our existing company processes--a neutral 3rd party to come in and offer suggestions, because sometimes it helps to have a fresh set of eyes on a set of problems.


##Front-End Engineers
The front-end engineers are focused on our client.
They work on the parts of our products that our users interact with--the UI for the Workflow Accelerator, for example.


##Support Engineers
Our support engineers work hard to ensure that any issues our users have are dealt with quickly and efficiently.
They are our customer service team.
They also coordinate with our technical writing team to ensure our user documentation is accurate and easy to understand.
They have deep knowledge of our products from our users' perspectives, which makes them a valuable part of our company.


##Technical Writers
Last (but certainly not least) we have our technical writing team.
They play an important but largely invisible role. T
hey focus on not just the user documentation for our suite of products, but also improving the language in the user interface of our products and translations.
They also produce various written works for our company, including our blogs (such as this article you are reading right now ;-))
