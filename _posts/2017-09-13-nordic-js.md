[Nordic.js](http://nordicjs.com/) is a JavaScript conference that takes place annually (since 2014) in Stockholm, Sweden.
We attended the 2017 conference; here's our perspective on the event.

## About the conference
The conference took place over two days (Thursday and Friday), which inspired us to combine it with a Stockholm sightseeing weekend ;-)
JavaScript celebrity [MPJ](https://twitter.com/mpjme) co-moderated the conference alongside with [Unn Swanström](https://twitter.com/unnderbar).
As there was only one track, disciplined visitors could catch all talks.
This year, Nordic.js was located in a former fabric hall in Stockholm's old industrial area *Sickla*.
The venue helped create a festival-like atmosphere and inspire creative thought.
The conference featured a broad range of talks with topics ranging from *accessibility* over *ECMAScript standardization* and *inclusion* to *web technology evolution*.


## Notable talks
While we genuinely enjoyed all talks, the following selection stroke us as particularly noteworthy.

### Harriet Lawrence on sociolinguistics in tech communications
In her talk *Sociolinguistics and the Javascript community: a love story*, Harriet elaborated on the importance of careful and explicit communications.
While Harriet's talk seemed to be targeted at open source contributors and maintainers, its essence applies to all software development projects and especially large-scale project that involve large and geographically distributed groups of people, who might not be aware of each other's cultural backgrounds and communication preferences.

Important advice she gave included:

* avoid sarcasm and in-jokes,
* don't assume highly specific technical expertise in how-tos and README files,
* alway provide **explicit** feedback.

The slides of her talk are available [here on GitHub](https://github.com/harrietgrace/talks/blob/master/jsconfeu2017-slides.pdf).

### Léonie Watson on accessibility
*You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!*

You find Léonie's slides at [http://decks.tink.uk/2017/frontendunited/index.html](http://decks.tink.uk/2017/frontendunited/index.html).

### Paul Kinlan on the future of the web
*The future of the web and the curious case of the unintended silo*

### Claudia Hernández on JavaScript without alphanumerics
Claudia's talk *Down the Rabbit Hole: JS in Wonderland* about curious JavaScript intricacies was arguably the most entertaining presentation of the conference.
The Dailymotion engineer presented a six-character (``(![]+)``) subset of JavaScript (as presented on [this website](http://www.jsfuck.com/)) that allows running any program by creatively exploiting JavaScript's lack of type safety.
For example, [this JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/7uph4tsd/) contains the ``(![]+)``-equivalent of ``alert('Signavio')``.
You find (a 2016 version of) Claudia's slides [here on Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/claudiahdz/down-the-rabbit-hole-javascript-in-wonderland).

## Conclusion
With its broad range of interesting talks and its friendly, creative atmosphere, Nordic.js is a welcome excuse to visit Stockholm and get a glimpse of late Scandinavian summer.
See you there next year!
