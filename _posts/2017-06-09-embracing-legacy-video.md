In an earlier blog post, Philipp Giese wrote about how to [Embrace legacy with constant change](dealing-with-client-legacy).
Since then, Phil gave a presentation on the same topic at a [Signavio Tech Talk](https://www.meetup.com/Signavio-Tech-Talks/events/237960063/) event.
Here’s the video of Phil’s presentation and slides.
