Some weeks ago I was asked to do a "techy talk" at Landing Festival, a recruiting event Signavio was also sponsoring.
Given that I didn't know what kind of backgorund the audience would have I chose a rather broad topic: "Agile".
However, I didn't want to go preaching "do this" and "do that" but rather give some advice on "what **not** to do".
Because over the past years I've come to the realization that more and more teams confuse "doing meetings and rituals from the Scrum book" with **being agile**.
And that's what this post is about.
