Every year, Signavio's hard-working engineering department splits into groups to work on a variety of projects that they create from brainstorming. They present these projects at the end of the yearly Code Camp in front of the entire company. The best project is selected by vote via the company, and it becomes the newest project that our team works on.

This year, we had 10 groups working on a variety of projects, from a private, in-house Slack services to a re-design of our Editor's shape menu. Here is a quick summary of each.

###### Mix-Me Mobile Lunch App

This app is an expanded idea of the Wednesday weekly tradition.

Described as "Tinder for food", this is an internal app for employees of Signavio. When a Signavian signs up for the service, they are randomly paired with a group of colleagues based on what they feel like having for lunch that day. The user can swipe "yes" or "no" on the group they are paired with.


###### Noise Levels

This is the brainchild of Sascha, our head Agile coach. A traffic light is hooked up to a microphone and an app. How it works is that the microphone allows the program to detect how much noise is being created in the office. A default noise level is set. The microphone allows the app to determine if the noise being created is above the default noise level. It will display a green light if itâ€™s okay, a yellow light if things are getting too noisy, or a red light if things need to be quieted immediately. In addition, a user can anonymously go into the app and trigger the light manually if they feel the office is getting too noisy for them to concentrate.

The idea, Sascha says, is to generally create an environment where people are aware of the noise they are creating and to try to be more considerate to their colleagues, regardless of where they are.

The physical light ended up not working, so our clever developers ended up creating a graphical interface with code. The program they wrote also allows users to see the graph of noise over time, so we can monitor how loud we really as a group and adjust accordingly.

###### Slacknavio


###### Fast Frictionless Fun

This group focused on making a mobile version of our Workflow Editor for Android. The main challenge for this group was making things lighter and faster than the desktop version, with comments and share capabilities as well as a way to check in on project details while on the go.


###### Alexa

Note.js, other processes, Alexa

This project focused on an actual use-case that involves integrating Alexa with our Workflow Accelerator. Say that a company's social media team wants to allow employees to send out tweets, but is unsure how to run a quality control process that would prevent any gaffes that might embarrass the company. Using Workflow Accelerator, you would be able to integrate it with Alexa. Simply dictate the tweet to Alexa, who will compare the text of the tweet to its library of acceptable syntax and phrasing. If the tweet is approved, the Workflow Accelerator will send an email to the social media team alerting them to the tweet and allowing them to either approve it or reject it.

If Alexa determines the tweet is not acceptable, it will reject it and ask the user to try again.

While Alexa will approve or reject the tweet, the social media team is ultimately responsible for the editing and posting of the tweet, who can then approve or reject the tweet, even if Alexa has already approved it.

The point of this project is to show the potential of our Workflow Accelerator when it comes to orchestrating different services and processing inputs with a set of other services (ie, Alexa).

It will allow all the different stakeholders to offer their input, and then hand it over to the developers to code a solution that will use the Workflow Accelerator as a process interface.  The chief concern is an easy to use integration that does not require a lot of coding to customize to a customer's needs.
