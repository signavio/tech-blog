Heyho! My name is Pascalis and I am a working student in our Process Intelligence team. So please bear in mind while reading this blog post that it is written from the perspective of a rather juvenile developer (who likes to emphasize the opposite whenever possible, though).

As in many companies, my so-called "pack" combines both frontend and backend developers, more or less keen on residing in there respective engineering domain. We have a Java Backend exposing a REST-API that is consumed by an `Apollo` `GraphQL` server. These two services need to agree on an API. To avoid too much conversational incentive, in usually short meetings the team defines the API's endpoints.

Often enough we face problems when the agreement made is not entirely followed through or interpreted differently by one of the involved parties. Thus being motivation to come up with a way to achieve _certainty_ about what is to be expected on both ends of the deal.

There are several things constantly enhancing my desire to work as a developer. Few beat my affection for slack bots and seemingly random acronyms. Unsurprisingly, the project's name was created long before most of the confluence page mapping out its future approach.

### SWAGSTER: `Swagger` Safe Typing Evaluation Repository.

![corresponding slack emoji](../2019/swagster-rick.jpg "Swagster Rick")

For everyone not familiar with Swagger.io, it is essentially a library that allows you to annotate your API related Java code to later on generate fancy overviews amongst other probably more relevant features (e.g. converts well to Postman).

With the generous help of a `gradle` plug-in simply called `swagger-gradle-plugin` and a corresponding `gradle` task, we are able to generate an `OpenAPI` `JSON` that is easily understood by Swagster.

```java
resolve {
    outputFileName = 'open_api_schema'
    outputFormat = 'JSON'
    prettyPrint = 'TRUE'
// ...
}
```

To attain above-mentioned certainty in our `NodeJS` clad `GraphQL` server "`fluffy`" (named after a three-headed dog better known within the Harry Potter universe), we would have to get rid of the uncertainty JavaScript tends to provide in regards of typing, replacing it with another popular superset, namely TypeScript.

Some very low-key `git` magic transmits the `JSON` over to the Swagster repo. This triggers a `CircleCI` job we mainly abuse as its "API", activating the pipeline.

### Now, the fun part begins.

`openapi-diff` is an `npm` package designed to differentiate between two given files. Don't be fooled by their documentation, you can run it just as much from your `node` environment as from the command line.
We make use of that by letting it identify for us, whether changes were made to the API.

If this turns out positive, we utilize the `ts-morph` `npm` package to convert the transmitted `OpenAPI` `JSON` file to TypeScript through code generation.
As far as I have sailed the vast ocean of JavaScript, there is no easy way to do this other than iterating over the file extracting various kinds of information with a multitude of `if`-statements.
We write the functions into a `RESTDataSource` class provided by `Apollo`. For further information please see https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/features/data-sources/.

### Example

Take this as part of the API specification in your OpenAPI file:

```json
"paths" : {
    "/houseelf/{houselfid}" : {
      "get" : {
        "operationId" : "getHouseElf",
        "parameters" : [ {
          "name" : "houselfid",
          "in" : "path",
          "required" : true,
          "schema" : {
            "type" : "string"
          }
        } ],
      "responses" : {
          "default" : {
            "description" : "default response",
            "content" : {
              "application/json" : {
                "schema" : {
                  "$ref" : "#/components/schemas/HouseElf"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
// ...
```

This is how it then looks like within our `RestDataSource` class:

```javascript
/*
 *  GET '/houseelf/{houselfid}'
 */
getHouseElf(houselfid: string): Promise<Components.Schemas.HouseElf> {
    return this.get(`/houseelf/${houselfid}`)
}
```

At the moment, we have our types produced by the `npm` package `dtsgen` as in here:

```
yarn dtsgen --out src/types.d.ts src/open_api_schema.json
```

Meanwhile a `Slack` message is generated enumerating the endpoints that underwent alteration, which is then send to our monitoring channel. I normally add some Rick and Morty emojis here for good measure.

Eventually, the newly generated TypeScript code is published to both the Swagster repository on `git` and `npm`.

You currently need to manually update `fluffy`'s Swagster `npm` package to apply its output to the `GraphQL` resolvers, thereby successfully concluding the type safety certainty effort from backend to `GraphQL` to frontend.
